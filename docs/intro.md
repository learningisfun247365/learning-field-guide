# Welcome to Maria's Field Guide

**Learning in public, building in the open** ðŸŒ±

This is my digital garden - a place where I document my learning journey, share insights, and build resources for fellow learners. Think of it as a field guide to learning itself, with real projects, experiments, and discoveries along the way.

## How to Use This Field Guide

Whether you're new to L&D or a seasoned practitioner, this field guide is designed to help you navigate the complexity of building learning programs that actually work.

### ðŸ§­ **Start Here**
- **[First Principles](./first-principles)**: The core beliefs that guide my work and learning
- **[About Me](./about-me)**: My background, philosophy, and why I built this

### ðŸŒ± **Core Framework**
- **[Field Guide to Learning](./field-guide/why-field-guide)**: Understanding learning as both process and product
- **[Building Learning Programs](./field-guide/thinking-models-ld)**: Practical methodology from sensing needs to shipping programs

### ðŸ“š **Real Examples**
- **[Projects & Case Studies](./projects/coffee-and-t)**: Behind-the-scenes looks at what I've built
- **[Library](./library)**: Books, films, and resources that shape my thinking

### âš¡ **Current Work**
- **[What I'm Working On Now](/now)**: Live updates on my experiments and discoveries

## Why Field Guide vs. Manual?

A manual gives you step-by-step instructions for known problems with established solutions.

A field guide helps you identify, recognize, and navigate what you encounter in real-world situations - assuming variability and requiring judgment to apply insights to your specific circumstances.

Your situation will be unique. This isn't "how to X" - it's what I've learned from building learning at companies where tech and tools change rapidly.
