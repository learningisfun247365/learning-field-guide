# Prototype – Define Shape, Not Content

*Coming soon - how to shape learning programs before building content.*

## What's the shape of this program before we fill in the content?

Define structure and flow without getting caught in content details.

## Actions
- Research - internal / external
- Create learning structure / arcs (Zero to Capable, challenge-first, toolkit-first)
- Build rough wireframes or storyboard of the experience

## Outputs
- Program shape (format, duration, learner profile, core flows)
- Early test script or walkthrough
- Constraints documented (tech stack, time, attention)

## Watch-Outs
- Over-polishing before testing
- Prototyping in isolation (no learner POV)

*Detailed content coming soon...*
