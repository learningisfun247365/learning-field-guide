# Phases of Work

*A systematic approach to building learning programs from idea to implementation*

## Overview

Building effective learning programs isn't linear, but having a framework helps you know where you are and what comes next. These phases provide structure while allowing for iteration and adaptation based on what you learn along the way.

## The Six Phases

### 1. 🎯 [Defining & Framing](phases/defining-framing)
**What's the real problem we're solving?**
- Sense the need and validate it's a learning problem
- Frame the challenge clearly
- Define success criteria
- Get stakeholder alignment

### 2. 🏗️ [Prototype](./prototype)
**Define shape, not content**
- Research internal and external approaches
- Create learning structure and flow
- Build rough wireframes of the experience
- Test the concept before building content

### 3. 🔨 [Build](./build)
**Use AI + modularity to go fast**
- Design sprints with SMEs for high-context knowledge
- Leverage AI for content creation and templates
- Build modular, reusable components
- Create MVP ready for feedback

### 4. 🧪 [Test](./test)
**Pilot, pulse, listen hard**
- Run pilot cohorts or sandbox versions
- Collect fast feedback through multiple channels
- Monitor drop-off points and confusion
- Document what works and what doesn't

### 5. 🔄 [Iterate](./iterate)
**Adapt without restarting**
- Analyze feedback and usage patterns
- Make targeted improvements
- Refine without rebuilding from scratch
- Plan for ongoing evolution

### 6. 🚀 [Deploy](./deploy)
**Ship + embed into flow of work**
- Launch through existing workflows
- Build in reinforcement and reminders
- Set up metrics and feedback loops
- Plan for maintenance and updates

## How to Use This Framework

### 🎯 **For New L&D Practitioners**
Start with **Defining & Framing** - don't jump straight to solutions. Spend time understanding the real problem and getting clear on what success looks like.

### 📈 **For Experienced Teams**
Use this as a **diagnostic tool** - where are you getting stuck? Which phase needs more attention? The framework helps identify gaps in your process.

### 🔄 **For Iterative Work**
You'll cycle through phases multiple times. That's normal! You might prototype, build a small test, learn something new, and go back to reframe the problem.

## Key Principles

- **Start with the problem, not the solution**
- **Build learning into every phase**
- **Ship small and iterate quickly**
- **Design for reuse and modularity**
- **Embed feedback loops throughout**

## What Makes This Different?

This isn't a waterfall process - it's a **field guide approach**. Each phase gives you tools to navigate real-world messiness, not a checklist to follow blindly. The goal is to help you make good decisions based on what you're seeing and learning.
