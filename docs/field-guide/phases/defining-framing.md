# Defining & Framing the Problem

*Coming soon - how to define learning challenges clearly.*

## What's the real problem we're solving?

Is learning the right lever? If so, why this and why now?

## Key Questions
- What is it? Short title + one-sentence description
- Why now? What signal are we responding to? What changed?
- Why it matters? What business goal or team priority does this accelerate?
- Who's it for? Define target learners clearly â€” not everyone
- What will it enable? Describe behavior or decision change
- What's the expected time to impact? How soon will this make a difference?
- How does it scale? Can we build this once and reuse across contexts?

## Actions
- Stakeholder interviews (what's the pain, what's the urgency?)
- Root cause analysis (5 Whys, constraints mapping)
- Determine if this is a learning problem or a workflow or clarity problem

## Outputs
- Problem 1-pager (tight, decision-enabling doc)
- Success criteria draft
- Go/no-go alignment

## Watch-Outs
- Jumping straight to content
- Misdiagnosing the real constraint
- No one owning the problem after launch

*Detailed content coming soon...*
