# Deploy – Ship + Embed Into Flow of Work

*Coming soon - how to ship learning programs that stick and integrate into daily work.*

## How do we ship this in a way that sticks?

Launch strategy that makes learning part of the natural workflow.

## Actions
- Push live through default workflow (not a new place to go)
- Layer in reminders, peer challenges, reflection nudges
- Set cadence to re-evaluate shelf life or update need

## Outputs
- Go-live comms + launch plan
- Metrics to track (completion is not enough — behavior?)
- Post-launch plan (e.g., embed in onboarding or performance cycles)

## Watch-Outs
- One-and-done mindset
- Shipping without reinforcement
