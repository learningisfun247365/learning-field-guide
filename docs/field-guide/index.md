# Field Guide to Learning

*Core methodology and framework for building effective learning programs*

## What You'll Find Here

This section contains the **core methodology** I've developed for building learning programs that actually work. It's organized into three main areas:

### üß≠ **Foundation & Philosophy**
- **[Why a Field Guide?](why-field-guide)** - The philosophy behind this approach vs. traditional manuals
- **[Thinking Models for Learning](thinking-models-learning)** - How learning actually works
- **[Thinking Models for L&D](thinking-models-ld)** - Frameworks for L&D practitioners

### üó∫Ô∏è **The Process: Phases of Work**
- **[Phases Overview](./phases/)** - Complete framework from idea to implementation
- **Six detailed phases:** Defining, Prototyping, Building, Testing, Iterating, Deploying

### üõ†Ô∏è **Practical Tools: Levers & Tactics**
- **AI-powered approaches** - Using technology to build faster
- **Collaboration methods** - Working effectively with SMEs
- **Decision frameworks** - When to build, buy, or ignore
- **Content strategies** - Choosing formats and building reusable components

## How to Use This Section

### üéØ **If you're new to L&D:**
Start with **[Why a Field Guide?](why-field-guide)** to understand the philosophy, then explore **[Thinking Models for Learning](thinking-models-learning)** to build your foundation.

### üìà **If you're building a program:**
Jump straight to **[Phases Overview](./phases/)** to see the complete process, then dive into the specific phase where you are now.

### üîß **If you need specific techniques:**
Browse the **Levers & Tactics** section for targeted tools and approaches you can apply immediately.

### ü§î **If you're stuck or struggling:**
Use this as a **diagnostic tool** - where in the process are you getting stuck? What thinking model or tactic might help?

## What Makes This Different?

This isn't a step-by-step manual. It's a **field guide** designed to help you:

- **Navigate real-world messiness** with flexible frameworks
- **Make good decisions** based on what you're observing
- **Build programs that stick** by embedding them into daily work
- **Move fast without sacrificing quality** using AI and modular approaches

## The Big Picture

Learning programs fail when we skip the hard work of **defining the real problem** and jump straight to content creation. This field guide gives you tools to:

1. **Sense and frame challenges clearly**
2. **Prototype solutions before building them**
3. **Build efficiently using modern tools**
4. **Test and iterate based on real feedback**
5. **Deploy in ways that create lasting change**
