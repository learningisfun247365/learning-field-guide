# How Cursor Tracked Decisions for You

*Coming soon - specific examples of how AI coding assistants maintain decision history.*

## Decision Documentation
How Cursor automatically captured the reasoning behind technical and design choices in this field guide project.

## Real Examples from This Project
- Color palette decision-making process
- Typography selection rationale
- Architecture choices and trade-offs
- Problem-solving iterations

## Key Insights
- AI tools can serve as both implementer and historian
- Prompting for decision rationale creates useful documentation
- Building in public with AI creates valuable learning artifacts
- Decision context is as important as the final solution

## Practical Applications
- Use AI to document why decisions were made
- Create decision logs automatically through conversation
- Build institutional memory through AI interactions
- Make tacit knowledge explicit through AI questioning
