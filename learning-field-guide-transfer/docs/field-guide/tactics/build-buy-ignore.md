# When to Build, When to Buy, When to Ignore

*Coming soon - decision framework for learning solution investments.*

## The Framework: Build / Buy / Borrow / Ignore

### Build
**When to build:**
- Unique to your context or competitive advantage
- No existing solution meets your specific needs
- You have capacity and capability
- Long-term strategic value

### Buy
**When to buy:**
- Standard solution exists and works well
- Cost-effective compared to building
- Vendor provides ongoing support and updates
- Not core to your competitive advantage

### Borrow
**When to borrow:**
- Open source or freely available solutions
- Internal tools from other teams
- Industry best practices you can adapt
- Temporary or pilot solutions

### Ignore
**When to ignore:**
- Not actually a learning problem
- Nice-to-have vs. need-to-have
- Limited impact or reach
- Resource constraints make other options impractical

## Decision Criteria
- Strategic importance
- Resource availability
- Time constraints
- Unique requirements
- Ongoing maintenance needs
- Total cost of ownership
