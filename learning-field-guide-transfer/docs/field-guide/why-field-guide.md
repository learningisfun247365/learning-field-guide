# Why a Field Guide?

*Coming soon - the philosophy behind field guides vs. manuals for learning.*

## Field Guide vs. Manual

A **manual** is a step-by-step instructional for how to accomplish X. They organize information sequentially around processes, assuming standardized conditions and predictable outcomes. They focus on execution rather than diagnosis, providing step-by-step guidance for known problems with established solutions.

A **field guide** is designed to help you identify, recognize, and navigate what you encounter in real-world situations. Field guides organize information around patterns, characteristics, and contextual clues that help you understand your environment and make informed decisions based on what you're observing. They assume variability and require judgment to apply insights to your specific circumstances.

## Why This Matters for Learning

Your situation will be unique, because, well, we work at different places. I don't ascribe myself as the voice for "how to X." This is what I've learned from building learning at technology companies in the past five years.
