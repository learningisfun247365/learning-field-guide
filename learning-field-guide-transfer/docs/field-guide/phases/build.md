# Build – Use AI + Modularity to Go Fast

*Coming soon - how to build learning content efficiently with AI assistance.*

## Content + Specificity

Move from shape to actual content and experience.

## Actions
- Design sprints or async flash bursts with SMEs
- Use AI + existing assets to create the first build
- Lean on modularity: base layers + contextual layers
- Partner with SMEs only where high-context or tacit knowledge is needed

## AI Tools Integration
Use AI tools (like Cursor) to:
- Draft content quickly using internal templates or example code
- Auto-generate outlines, scenarios, quizzes, and instructions
- Pull past SME interviews or docs
- Document decisions along the way (prompted: "Why did we go with X format?")

This becomes part of your program documentation, and makes maintenance/refinement scalable later.

## Outputs
- MVP of content and experience
- Integration with delivery channels (Slack, LMS, Notion, etc.)
- Ready-for-feedback version

## Watch-Outs
- Scope creep ("we need to include everything")
- Waiting on SME perfection
