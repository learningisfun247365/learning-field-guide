# Iterate – Adapt Without Restarting

*Coming soon - how to improve learning programs based on feedback.*

## Adaptation Strategy

Make meaningful improvements without throwing away what's working.

## Key Principles
- Build on successful elements
- Address specific pain points identified in testing
- Maintain core structure while refining content
- Version control for learning content

## Actions
- Analyze feedback patterns and priorities
- Identify quick wins vs. major revisions
- Update modular components without breaking the whole
- Test changes with subset of users first

## Outputs
- Updated program version
- Change log and decision rationale
- Improved learner experience

## Watch-Outs
- Over-iterating based on vocal minority
- Changing everything at once
- Not documenting what changed and why

*Detailed content coming soon...*
