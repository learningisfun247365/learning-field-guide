# First Principles

The core beliefs that govern my work, thought, and life.

## 1. Learning is iterative, not linear

True understanding comes through cycles of exploration, experimentation, and reflection. There's no straight path from question to answer.

*Every "failure" is data. Every detour teaches something. The goal isn't efficiencyâ€”it's understanding.*

## 2. Share the messy middle

The polished final product rarely shows the real learning. The struggles, false starts, and breakthroughs happen in the messy middle.

*Document the journey, not just the destination. Others learn more from your process than your polish.*

## 3. Build in public, learn in community

Learning accelerates when we do it together. Questions spark better questions. Different perspectives reveal blind spots.

*Your learning becomes more valuable when others can build on it. Isolation is the enemy of growth.*

## 4. Context is everything

What works depends on who you are, where you are, and what you're trying to achieve. Universal solutions are usually universally wrong.

*Always ask: "For whom? In what situation? With what constraints?" Context turns principles into practice.*

## 5. Start before you're ready

Waiting for perfect conditions, complete knowledge, or total confidence means never starting. Motion creates clarity.

*The best way to learn something is to start doing it poorly. Iteration beats ideation every time.*
